# The Gifts That Keep On Giving

## 5 Gift Subscription Ideas For Your Special Someone

With a little help from your friends at Unfunny, you may well achieve superhero status for picking the perfect present this Valentine's Day. But as the days and weeks wear on, the colours on that costume may begin to fade. Letterbox subscriptions to the rescue! Give a gift that keeps on giving and your partner will be reminded of your undying love for them on an ongoing basis. Hello perennial prestige!

## 1\. Flowers Are For Life, Not Just For Valentine's Day

Flowers might not be the first product category that springs to mind 
when thinking of gifts that would fit through your letterbox. But [Bloom and Wild][0]
have perfected the art of bundling bouquets into slim-fit parcels. Who 
wouldn't love to receive a beautiful bouquet every month? The fresh 
flowers will arrive just in time to replace the previous pack. Your home
will be fragrant and floral year-round, and you'll both reap some of 
the [proven benefits][1]
of having flowers around the house, such as reduced stress and elevated
happiness levels. You can even add a personalised message that reminds 
your chosen one why they're so special to you.

£20 per bouquet when ordered on an on-going subscription.

## 2\. Say It With Socks... criptions

Socks may not scream 
romance at the top of their little sock lungs, but everybody wears them,
everybody needs them, and there's nothing quite like the feeling of 
donning a fresh pair for the first time. So give your other half that 
wonderful fresh-sock smile on an on-going basis toss out their hole-y 
old stinkers.

[Henry J Socks][2] offer simple subscription packages
starting at £5 a month. These brightly patterned beauties will liven up any
dull old pair of standard-issue human feet.

## 3\. Give Us This Month Our Monthly Chocolates

Can't go wrong with chocolate, right? But if your lover is a real 
cacao-head, you'll have to go above and beyond a box of Quality Street 
from the all-night garage.

For the true connoisseur of the 
cocoa bean, get them a  [Cocoa 
Runners][3] subscription, starting at £16.65 a month. They'll receive a 
monthly pack of four high-end craft chocolate bars from around the 
world, with tasting notes for each bar.

If you don't want to 
splash out for the recurring cost, they've also put together a [special 
Valentine's collection][4]. A great one-off alternative for your special little chocoholic.

## 4\. Stacked To The Rafters

Is your partner the creatively curious type? Into good design, long 
reads and heavy paper stock? Can they spend hours at a time browsing the
magazine racks at Foyles or Magma?

Buy them a [Stack ][5]
subscription and they'll love you forever. They'll get a different 
high-quality independent magazine every month. It'll be a magnificent 
surprise every time a new magazine drops onto the doormat.

Books more their bag when it comes to reading matter? [Daunt Books ][6]offer hand-picked, gift-wrapped selections tailored to your partner's tastes.

## 5\. Coffee Coffee Tea Tea

If your loved one is a caffeine connoisseur , you'd do well to treat 
them to a [Pact ][7]subscription. They'll select world-class beans, hand 
roast them and grind them to match your partner's preferred brewing 
technique. Then they'll package them up to fit through your letterbox.

Customise your order depending on how often your lover loves to drink coffee, and how they like to make it.

Better
half got more of a taste for tea? There's a subscription for that. From
£10 a month [London Tea Club][8] will send a selection that'll have them 
dancing the cha-cha.
