# The 5 Cutest Valentine's Day Cards This Side of Equestria 

## 1\. Donut Sleep on This One

Kawaii smiles, hand-holding, hundreds and thousands, pun-based humour. This card couldn't get any sweeter if it was dipped in frosting and dusted with icing sugar. And if donuts are a little sugary for your tastes, check out the rest of the cutie-pie puns at the [Magically Crafted][0] Etsy shop ([You're My Cup Of Tea][1] is another strong favourite). [£2.80 shipped to the UK][2], £4.30 everywhere else. 

## 2\. Keytar Hero

Is there a cuter instrument than the keytar? If there is I don't want to know about it. Half-keyboard, half guitar, all-awesomeness. Show your loved one that they're the keytar hero in your life. [£3.40 shipped to the UK][3], from £4.65 elsewhere.

## 3\. Yeah, Doge

Doge's [meme moment][4] may have passed, but the Shiba Inu may never be surpassed in puppy-dog cuteness levels. [Ships to the UK for £5.32][5] from the US, but if you miss the shipping deadline there's also a [digital version][6] available. And in the [Tiny Bee][7] Etsy shop you'll find many more examples of such romance.

## 4\. Dino-mite Pun-work

Sometimes you need to say it with dinosaurs. Adorable, roar-some little line-drawing dinosaurs with a little love heart stuck to their bums. This is the card for that. [£4.20 shipped to the UK][8].

## 5\. Sugar For Your Honey

Let your valentine know you think they're sweeter than a whole bag of sugar. [£2.50 shipped to the UK][9].
