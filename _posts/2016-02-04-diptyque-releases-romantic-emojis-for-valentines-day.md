It's released to coincide with a limited edition collection created in collaboration with fashion designer Olympia Le Tan. Entitled "La clef de mon cœur est dans mon sac" (the key to my heart is in my bag), the collection contains a new "Rosaviola" fragrance, available in candles and as a solid perfume. Meant to evoke the content's of a lady's handbag, there are notes of lipstick and leather together with a predominance of roses and violets. ![Limited Edition packaging for Eau Rose by Diptyque](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6c917327-2693-441b-9edb-b94881e447ff.jpg)

The classic "Eau Rose" range has had a packaging makeover, with Le Tan's playful illustrations given pride of place. 

[From £20][3], these make great gift ideas for those with a nose for fine fragrance and an eye for whimsical design.
